    WLpyramid package contains an implementation of the pyramid quantized
    Weisfeiler-Lehman graph representation, which is code for pyramid
    quantization of the label space and code of Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel
    (file WLkernel.m), provided in the webpage ::
    http://www.di.ens.fr/~shervashidze/code.html
    It was tested in matlab version 20013 and provides no warranties.
